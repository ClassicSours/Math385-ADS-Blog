Today I'll be talking about the ["Hamilton Dashboard"](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/) this is a cool website that shows the influence of Russia on twitter.  As of the time I'm writing this post they are talking about '#trumpville' and '#DACA'.  I want to talk about this because [Of this video](https://youtu.be/hWLjYJ4BzvI).  What is going on in the political landscape of our country is as its never been since the foundation of the country.
