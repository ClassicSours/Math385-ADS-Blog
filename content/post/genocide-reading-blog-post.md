Genocide through Data Science is without a doubt something that is extremely scary.  Pre-existing beliefs make their way into models and then are used to convince other people on decisions that effect the lives of hundreds, thousands, even millions or billions of people.  Computers are products of their environment, algorithms don't make things up from nowhere.  Data is fed into them that influnces their models based on socio-economic norms and standards from the past which was much less open minded and equality oriented than the present.  The unintended consequences of bad models and people using them for harm or people simply not understanding them is really scary butthere is simply to much information out there for everyone to become experts overnight so people have to be more responsible producing and consuming all of the information available to them.

The part on hiring scares me a little to be honest.  As an Individual I feel that people should be hired based on their qualifications for a position and not to help the company reach certain ratios.  

I think the underlying problem with data science in this field is that science and technology is evolving faster than any government system can hope to keep up with.  Policy and politics are slow, and the power of data science needs to be handled responsibly by researchers and firms so that things don't get out of control and we end up in the Matrix or some other insane dystopian future.
